# HOWTOs

## How to display plans graphically

The query plans represented by `LogicalPlan` nodes can be graphically
rendered using [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/).

To do so, save the output of the `display_graphviz` function to a file.:

```rust
// Create plan somehow...
let mut output = File::create("/tmp/plan.dot")?;
write!(output, "{}", plan.display_graphviz());
```

Then, use the `dot` command line tool to render it into a file that
can be displayed. For example, the following command creates a
`/tmp/plan.pdf` file:

```bash
dot -Tpdf < /tmp/plan.dot > /tmp/plan.pdf
```

## How to format `.md` document

We are using `prettier` to format `.md` files.

You can either use `npm i -g prettier` to install it globally or use `npx` to run it as a standalone binary. Using `npx` required a working node environment. Upgrading to the latest prettier is recommended (by adding `--upgrade` to the `npm` command).

```bash
$ prettier --version
2.3.0
```

After you've confirmed your prettier version, you can format all the `.md` files:

```bash
prettier -w {datafusion,datafusion-cli,datafusion-examples,dev,docs}/**/*.md
```

## How to format `.toml` files

We use `taplo` to format `.toml` files.

For Rust developers, you can install it via:

```sh
cargo install taplo-cli --locked
```

> Refer to the [Installation section][doc] on other ways to install it.
>
> [doc]: https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/cli/installation/binary.html

```bash
$ taplo --version
taplo 0.9.0
```

After you've confirmed your `taplo` version, you can format all the `.toml` files:

```bash
taplo fmt
```

## How to update protobuf/gen dependencies

The prost/tonic code can be generated by running `./regen.sh`, which in turn invokes the Rust binary located in [gen](./gen)

This is necessary after modifying the protobuf definitions or altering the dependencies of [gen](./gen), and requires a
valid installation of [protoc] (see [installation instructions] for details).

```bash
./regen.sh
```
